# Azure Deployment Security Best Practices

When deploying your AI Evangelist website to Azure Static Web Apps, following these security best practices will help protect your website and Azure resources from potential threats.

## Securing Your Azure Account

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **Enable MFA for all Azure accounts**: This adds an essential second layer of security beyond just passwords
- **How to enable**: Go to Azure Portal > Azure Active Directory > Security > Authentication methods > Policies
- **Recommendation**: Use the Microsoft Authenticator app for the most secure experience

### Access Management
- **Use least privilege principle**: Grant only the permissions necessary for each user or service
- **Create dedicated deployment accounts**: Use separate accounts for deployment rather than your primary admin account
- **Regularly audit access**: Review who has access to your Azure resources quarterly

## Securing Your Static Web App

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Set up role assignments**: Define who can manage your Static Web App in Azure
- **Configure access restrictions**: Limit access to your Azure resources by IP address where possible
- **Use managed identities**: For connecting to other Azure services rather than storing credentials

### Data Protection
- **Enable Azure Defender**: For advanced threat protection across your Azure services
- **Encrypt sensitive data**: Don't store unencrypted sensitive information in your static website files
- **Use Azure Key Vault**: For storing any API keys or secrets your website might need

## Deployment Security

### GitHub Integration Security (if using GitHub)
- **Secure your GitHub account**: Enable two-factor authentication
- **Review GitHub Actions workflows**: Ensure they don't expose sensitive information
- **Use GitHub secrets**: For storing any sensitive values needed during deployment
- **Limit repository access**: Only grant access to team members who need it

### Direct Upload Security (if using CLI)
- **Secure your API key**: Never share or expose your Static Web App deployment API key
- **Rotate API keys regularly**: Generate new keys periodically
- **Use dedicated deployment machines**: Deploy from secure, trusted computers

## Network Security

### Azure Front Door (Optional Enhancement)
- **Consider adding Azure Front Door**: For additional layer of protection against DDoS attacks
- **Configure WAF policies**: To protect against common web vulnerabilities
- **Set up rate limiting**: To prevent brute force attacks

### Custom Domain Security
- **Enable HTTPS only**: Enforce HTTPS for all traffic (enabled by default in Azure Static Web Apps)
- **Configure proper CORS settings**: If your website makes API calls
- **Implement CSP headers**: To prevent cross-site scripting attacks

## Monitoring and Response

### Azure Security Center
- **Enable Azure Security Center**: For comprehensive security monitoring
- **Review security recommendations**: Address any issues identified by Security Center
- **Set up alerts**: For unusual activity or potential security incidents

### Logging and Auditing
- **Enable diagnostic logging**: To track access and changes to your Static Web App
- **Set up Azure Monitor**: For monitoring performance and detecting anomalies
- **Establish incident response plan**: Document steps to take if a security incident occurs

## Regular Maintenance

### Updates and Patches
- **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update any libraries or frameworks used in your website
- **Monitor security advisories**: Stay informed about vulnerabilities in technologies you use
- **Test updates before deployment**: Verify updates don't break functionality before pushing to production

### Security Scanning
- **Perform regular security scans**: Use tools like OWASP ZAP to identify vulnerabilities
- **Conduct penetration testing**: Consider periodic professional security assessments
- **Validate content security**: Ensure all content is properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Residency
- **Choose appropriate region**: Ensure your Static Web App is deployed in a region that meets any data residency requirements
- **Review compliance documentation**: Azure provides compliance information for various standards and regulations
- **Document compliance measures**: Keep records of security measures for audit purposes

## Recovery Planning

### Backup Strategy
- **Maintain source code backups**: Keep backups of your website files separate from your deployment repository
- **Document configuration settings**: Record all Azure configuration settings
- **Test restoration process**: Periodically verify you can restore your website if needed

### Disaster Recovery
- **Create a recovery plan**: Document steps to recover your website in case of major issues
- **Set up monitoring alerts**: To quickly detect outages or performance issues
- **Consider multi-region deployment**: For critical websites that require high availability

By following these security best practices, you'll significantly reduce the risk of security incidents and ensure your AI Evangelist website remains secure and available to your users.
